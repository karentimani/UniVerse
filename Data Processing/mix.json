                                "The BFA in Fashion Design, in collaboration with Elie Saab and the London College of Fashion, is modeled on the best fashion design programs offered at leading universities in the UK and the USA, and based on a rigorous four-year curriculum.",
                                "Students enrolled in this major are required to first complete the common one-year foundation study program. The degree requires both traditional and computer-aided design skills and hands-on construction and production training, which are introduced in the foundation year and then further developed during the following three years.",
                                "The proposed curriculum balances theoretical and creative processes of fashion design with the technical and practical components required for success. Students are taught to become designers with a unique vision centered on their own approaches to fashion and to further develop skills necessary for success, including entrepreneurship and business skills."

                                "The aim of offering a minor in history is to give the students an additional edge in their major fields. A student in Political Science and International relations often has to take at least one course in history as an elective. Many of the courses offered by the history program are natural complements for students in Political Science and International relations. Even students in a seemingly unrelated field such as architecture or biology will benefit from a minor in history as it will enable them to become well rounded human beings. A class which features the art and architecture of the Renaissance would be a great boon to an architecture student.\nThe skills that the student will acquire from an exposure to history will enable them to think critically and comparatively. Even in their daily lives, particularly in the region where LAU is situated, every day involves some reference to history. Islam, modernity, ethnicity, inter-faith relations, the Arab/Israeli conflict, themes and topics which we are bombarded with on a daily basis, acquire perspective only when seen in a historical context."

The study of electrical engineering can be conveniently divided into the areas of circuits, electronics, electromagnetism, electric energy systems, communications, control, and computer engineering. Due to the extremely rapid growth and change in the application of electrical engineering principles, the curriculum is designed to concentrate on a solid core of basic foundation courses, covering all areas of electrical engineering. As part of the academic program, six credits of professional experience are also included in the last summer prior to graduation to give students an opportunity to integrate classroom instruction with practical work experience. Students also have the choice to follow an Extended Experiential Learning Study Plan, which requires performing an extended professional experience for an extra semester (Fall or Spring, spanning 6 uninterrupted months) to further gain from working on real-life problems.",

A typical schedule is listed below and extends over a four-year period, including summer semester; students may select to take these courses over a longer period of time."
