A student in Political Science and International relations often has to take at least one course in history as an elective. Many of the courses offered by the history program are natural complements for students in Political Science and International relations. Even students in a seemingly unrelated field such as architecture or biology will benefit from a minor in history as it will enable them to become well rounded human beings. A class which features the art and architecture of the Renaissance would be a great boon to an architecture student.\nThe skills that the student will acquire from an exposure to history will enable them to think critically and comparatively. Even in their daily lives, particularly in the region where LAU is situated, every day involves some reference to history. Islam, modernity, ethnicity, inter-faith relations, the Arab/Israeli conflict, themes and topics which we are bombarded with on a daily basis, acquire perspective only when seen in a historical context.",

These competencies make the minor an invaluable complement to virtually any major, expanding career possibilities and strengthening readiness for competitive graduate programs. Employers and academic institutions alike prioritize the technical proficiency, adaptability, and systematic reasoning honed through physics training.\nIdeal for STEM-focused disciplines, the program offers distinct advantages to students majoring in engineering, renewable energy, data science, mathematics, or environmental science, where physics principles underpin innovation in areas like materials design, climate modeling, and sustainable technologies. It also proves particularly valuable for pre-medical tracks, as physics drives advancements in medical imaging, radiation therapy, and biomechanical research.\nBeyond traditional STEM fields, the minor bridges into emerging domains. Computer science students gain exposure to computational physics and quantum mechanics—skills increasingly vital for breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, cryptography, and quantum computing. Similarly, finance and economics majors can leverage physics-inspired quantitative modeling to excel in algorithmic trading, risk management, and complex systems analysis.\nBy integrating physics with diverse disciplines, the minor prepares students to tackle multifaceted challenges at the intersection of science, technology, and society, positioning them as versatile thinkers in an evolving global landscape.",

The study of electrical engineering can be conveniently divided into the areas of circuits, electronics, electromagnetism, electric energy systems, communications, control, and computer engineering. Due to the extremely rapid growth and change in the application of electrical engineering principles, the curriculum is designed to concentrate on a solid core of basic foundation courses, covering all areas of electrical engineering. As part of the academic program, six credits of professional experience are also included in the last summer prior to graduation to give students an opportunity to integrate classroom instruction with practical work experience. Students also have the choice to follow an Extended Experiential Learning Study Plan, which requires performing an extended professional experience for an extra semester (Fall or Spring, spanning 6 uninterrupted months) to further gain from working on real-life problems.\nThe B.E. in Electrical Engineering program is credit-based and requires the completion of 150 semester hours.

Today, Mechatronics Engineering has evolved to become an explicit and in-demand multi-disciplinary specialization that stands on its own due to rapid advances in modern automation and artificial intelligence in addition to the evolution of complex and intelligent machines.\nEvery day, mechatronics engineers are involved in the research and development of state-of-the-art technologies in automation, control and robotic systems that are widely adopted in the fields of medicine, security, energy, construction, and economics, to name a few. Some example applications include driver-less autonomous vehicles, medical robots, exoskeletons, artificial human limbs and smart building management systems.",
